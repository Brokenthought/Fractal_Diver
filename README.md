Fractal creation &amp; exploration

<h2>About </h2>
Fractal diver is an app created to generate and explore fractals, it was made using the unity engine.

Mandelbrot set: 
The most iconic fractal set, although the mandelbrot can in theory be zoomed into endlessly, there are practical limits based on computing power.

Julia set: 
The julia set is closely connected with the mandelbrot set and has shapes very similar to it. 
The julia set changes dramatically depending on the inputs cX and cY.

Settings page: 
Because fractals can be computationally expensive, the settings page allows for users to adjust the resolution and depth of the fractals. If there is lag or stuttering lowers the resolution or depth should greatly improve performance.

Color Scheme:
Additionally in the settings page there is the option to change the color scheme of the fractals,
altering the red, green, and blue sliders can produce a wide variety of shapes and patterns in the fractal sets.
